# Revent Dynamic Product Component

Welcome to the Revent Dynamic Product Component! This project showcases my proficiency in React.js as part of the Front-End Developer (React) assignment.

## Task Overview

The goal of this assignment was to create a responsive web component that allows users to browse and filter a collection of products. The component includes the following features:

### Product Display:
- Displays a list of products with their names, images, prices, and short descriptions.

### Filtering:
- Implements a filter mechanism allowing users to filter products based on categories (e.g., electronics, clothing) and price range.

### Search Functionality:
- Includes a search bar allowing users to search for products by name or description.

### Sorting:
- Provides multiple sorting options based on price (low to high, high to low) and customer rating.

### Responsive Design:
- Ensures the component is fully responsive and provides an optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
