# Revent Dynamic Product Component

Welcome to the Revent Dynamic Product Component! This project showcases my proficiency in React.js as part of the Front-End Developer (React) assignment.

## Task Overview

The goal of this assignment was to create a responsive web component that allows users to browse and filter a collection of products. The component includes the following features:

### Product Display:
- Displays a list of products with their names, images, prices, and short descriptions.

### Filtering:
- Implements a filter mechanism allowing users to filter products based on categories (e.g., electronics, clothing) and price range.

### Search Functionality:
- Includes a search bar allowing users to search for products by name or description.

### Sorting:
- Provides multiple sorting options based on price (low to high, high to low) and customer rating.

### Responsive Design:
- Ensures the component is fully responsive and provides an optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technology Stack

- React.js

## Additional Libraries/Frameworks

- Chakra UI: Chakra UI provides a set of accessible and composable components for building React applications. I chose it for its simplicity and the ability to quickly create visually appealing interfaces.

- Styled-Components: Styled-Components allows for component-level styles to be written in JavaScript. It provides a clean and organized way to style React components, making it easy to manage CSS in a component-based architecture.

- Redux: Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps manage the global state of the application, which is crucial for handling complex interactions and state changes in a React application.

- Swiper: Swiper is a touch-enabled, responsive slider library. I integrated it to enhance the user experience when navigating through product images.

## Data Source

- JSON Server: JSON Server is a full fake REST API tool that allows for rapid prototyping and testing. It provided a simple way to simulate a backend API for this project.

## Design Considerations

I focused on creating an intuitive and visually appealing user interface, paying close attention to usability and accessibility principles.
